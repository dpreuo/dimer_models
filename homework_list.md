# Homework:

  - generate hexagon lattice, using the two square combining algorithm we talked about, more complete elimination of squares. Do the naughty islands vanish?
  - run algorithm for slowly reducing number of squares, is the change abrupt or a crossover?
  - check the height-height and dimer-dimer correlations (they should be related - but how are they?)
  - run square lattice and check what that gives 
  -  Look at weaire thorpe resolvent trick, how general is it and can it bound the greens functions and thus the dimer probs. 
  - finish analytics and check against numerics
